## Live Project: [The Pancake House](https://pancakehouse.dev/)

See [**semantic HTML**](https://github.com/CarlsJr4/breakfastCafe/blob/master/index.html) \
See [**CSS with advanced selectors**](https://github.com/CarlsJr4/breakfastCafe/blob/master/stylesheets/pages/_home.scss)

This project was a response to the several restaurant websites on the internet that are difficult to use. After scanning these websites, the main problems I found were: non-mobile responsive, menu was a static image, cluttered interface, difficult to find contact info. 

To challenge myself, I wrote this website with no CSS frameworks. Semantic HTML, media queries, CSS grid, and SCSS were used in place. The result is a very simple and easy-to-navigate website that only requires 1 page to get its point across.
